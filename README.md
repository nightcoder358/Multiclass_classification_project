# 🐾 Wild Animal Classifier — A Multiclass Classification Project

Welcome to my **Multiclass Classification** project — developed and submitted as part of the **Data Analytics Lab** in the **6th semester of my 4-year undergraduate degree program at Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University**.

This project is a **solution to one of the practice problem statements hosted on [DataDriven.org](https://datadriven.org/)**, where the task was to **classify different wild animals based on various features** using supervised machine learning.

## 📌 What is Multiclass Classification?

**Multiclass classification** is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to assign each input sample to **one of three or more possible classes**. Unlike binary classification (which predicts one of two classes), multiclass models deal with **more complex decision boundaries**, making them ideal for applications like animal recognition, disease detection, or sentiment analysis.
